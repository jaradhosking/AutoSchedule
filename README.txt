AutoSchedule

DESCRIPTION
This web app allows a user to automatically find
class schedules.  They can choose a semester,
courses they have to take, a list of courses
they would not mind taking, and the minimimum / 
maximum number of credit hours they would be
comfortable taking.  Our program then finds such
schedules, and ranks them based off of expected
GPA and rate my professor reviews.


INSTALLATION
To lauch, navigate to code/webpages/index.html.


EXECUTION
Unfortunately, due to issues described in the report,
the UI is not connected to our backend.  Normally,
one would simply be able to insert their desired
inputs into the website, and the program would
automatically execute.
